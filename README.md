# Dijkstra-s_Algorithm
This algorithm finds the shortest path to all nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The example graph that I used for this project can be seen in the image below.

The output for the program is: 
```
Distance from A is 0 last vertex is A
Distance from B is 4 last vertex is A
Distance from C is 2 last vertex is A
Distance from D is 6 last vertex is B
Distance from F is 10 last vertex is C
Distance from G is 5 last vertex is C
Distance from H is 11 last vertex is J
Distance from J is 9 last vertex is G
```

The numbers on the lines (called edges) between the graphs are the weights between the nodes. 
This project was programmed only using pseudocode online. The exact implementation is my own and uses Java as the language.
